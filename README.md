Some tools for working with US Census Data

Starting Notes:

The initial toolset is for loading ACS data into a PostGRES database. 

It's not currently setup to deal with multiple state's worth of data (the logrecno's are not unique across states).

If you want commit access let me know your gitub account, and a general description of who you are and what you want to do.
